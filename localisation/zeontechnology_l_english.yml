It began on January 3, UC 0079, when the Principality of Zeon launched surprise attacks against the Earth Federation's territory.\n\nThe turning point of the war was in November, when the Earth Federation launched Operation Odessa, a counteroffensive against Zeon forces in eastern Europe. Using entirely conventional forces, the Earth Federation was defeated, forcing much of their force to retreat or surrender. Soon after, Zeon launched its own counteroffensive, attacking first the EFSF headquarters at Luna II, and then defeating the Federation forces gathered at Jaburo. After the Federation's defeat at Jaburo, the Federation officially surrendered, ending the war on January 1, UC 0080.\n\nNot long after, there was a sudden breakthrough in warp technology..."
